/// @brief Provide access to file data and metadata.
///
/// This module contains classes and non-member functions that deal with
/// filesystem operations. Specifically, it aims to:
///
/// * Allow access to file data in a manner compatible with Asio and the Networking TS.
///   * This includes support for Asio's `*Stream` type requirements
///     (*SyncReadStream*, *SyncRandomAccessReadDevice*, ...)
///   * as well as an asynchronous I/O interface for files (@ref asioext::basic_file),
///     with currently one implementation:
///     * @ref asioext::thread_pool_file_service (Blocking I/O operations are performed on the
///       thread-pool.)
/// * Provide accessors and modifiers for file metadata, including:
///   * File size
///   * File permissions
///   * File attributes
///   * File time info (ctime, mtime, ...)
/// * Utilities for reading/writing files:
///   * @ref asioext::read_file
///   * @ref asioext::write_file

/// @ingroup files
/// @defgroup files_handle File handles

/// @ingroup files
/// @defgroup files_meta File metadata
