/// This class template provides basic utilities for custom operations
/// that support user-supplied Handlers.
///
/// The operation class assumes that the the given Handler needs to be
/// executed on a specific io_service. It ensures that said io_service
/// doesn't run out of work until the handler was dispatched.
///
/// This class is intended for custom operations that are executed
/// on different io_service(s) than the user-supplied handler.
/// For example, a service that internally uses a separate io_service
/// object to do its work, still needs to execute the user's handler
/// inside the original io_service that owns the service object.
